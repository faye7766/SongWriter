# SongWriter
We all love songs. Not only music, good lyrics are also an essential part that build up good songs. However, writing lyrics is not very easy and may take a long time for songwriters to come up with new ideas for songs.

In this project, I investigated the song datasets to get ideas of how typical song lyrics are like and also built up a lyrics generator which generates new original lyrics from different music genre or artist.

The lyrics generator can provide inspirations for songwriters and also get a new song lyrics done with a simple phrase.
